              People who have never traveled alone often describe their first solo trip as an almost religious
              experience. To take in new surroundings unfiltered by the prejudices, tastes, or preferences of a
              traveling companion can be heady stuff. Traveling alone gives you the chance to indulge yourself fully.

              Of course, single travel has its perils too—such as safety concerns, loneliness, and the dreaded single
              supplement. But a little preparation and common sense can save you money and get you through the rough
              spots.

              Why Travel Alone?
              Solo travel can be the ultimate in self-indulgence; you can rest when you want and pour it on when you’re
              feeling ambitious. Another benefit is that your mistakes are your own, and your triumphs all the more
              exciting. There’s no worrying that your insistence on trekking all the way across town to a museum that
              was closed ruined your partner’s day; it’s your own day to salvage or chalk up to a learning experience.
              Also, you can do exactly what you want to do—all the time. Always wanted to try surfing? Sign up for a
              class and go for it; there’s no one sitting on the beach bored while you have the time of your life. Have
              no desire to see Niagara Falls? Just drive right by. For more benefits of solo travel, see 11 Reasons Why
              You Should Travel Alone at Least Once.

              How to Travel Alone Safely
              Perhaps the foremost concern of the solo or single traveler is safety. Without a companion to watch your
              back, you are more vulnerable to criminals and scam artists, as well as simple health worries. But the
              saying “safety in numbers” isn’t necessarily true—a solo traveler can blend in more easily than a group,
              and not drawing attention to yourself as a tourist is one way to stay secure. Here are a few safety tips
              for traveling alone:

              Know how long it takes and how much it costs to get from the airport to your hotel or to the city center.
              Solo travelers are more likely to be “taken for a ride,” so ask the taxi driver for an estimated fare
              before you leave. If it’s considerably different from what you know to be true, take a different cab (or
              opt for a rideshare instead).

              Book a hotel with a 24-hour front desk if you’ll be arriving late, so you don’t end up sleeping in your
              car or worse.

              Be your own best counsel; if it doesn’t feel right, don’t do it.

              Carry good identification, in more than one place.

              Stick to open and public places, especially at night.

              Exude confidence and walk purposefully.

              Avoid appearing like a tourist. Ditch the Disney T-shirt and don’t walk around with your face in a
              guidebook. (See 10 Things You Should Never Wear Abroad for more thoughts on this one.)

              Don’t draw attention to yourself by wearing flashy clothes or jewelry.

              Lie a little. When asking directions, don’t let on that you are alone: “Can you direct me to the museum? I
              have to meet a friend.”

              Check your maps and transportation schedules before leaving your hotel/train/rental car/tourist office. A
              solo traveler who’s too absorbed in her phone can be a mark for unsavory types.

              Leave a copy of your itinerary with a friend or family member at home, and stay in touch regularly via
              phone, text, video chat, or email.

              For U.S. citizens traveling internationally, consider signing up for the free Smart Traveler Enrollment
              Program (STEP), which could help the State Department assist you in case of emergency. If you’re from
              outside the States, see if your home country has a similar program.

              One of the best reasons to travel alone is to meet new people, but this also makes you more vulnerable.
              It’s okay to hang out, travel, and share with new friends, but you might not want to ask them to hold your
              money. Scam artists can often be the most charming companions you’ll find; you want to be open-minded, but
              keep your guard up enough to ensure your safety.

              Avoiding the Single Supplement
              Frequent solo travelers are all too familiar with the single supplement, which tour operators, cruise
              lines, and hotels often tack onto your bill to make up for the fact that they’re not making money off a
              second occupant. The supplement can range anywhere from 25 to 100 percent of the trip cost, meaning that
              you could end up paying twice as much as someone traveling with a partner.

              There are several ways to get around the single supplement. You can avoid it altogether by booking with a
              tour operator that offers roommate matching, such as G Adventures, Intrepid Travel, or Road Scholar. By
              finding you a roommate, the company maximizes its own profit off each room and saves you the single
              supplement. The catch is, of course, that you’ll have to share a room with a stranger. If you’re
              concerned, contact the tour operator and see what kind of procedures they use to match roommates. Some
              pair people off at random, while others will make an effort to put complementary personalities together.

              Several cruise lines offer single staterooms on select ships, including Royal Caribbean, Norwegian Cruise
              Line, Cunard, and P&O Cruises.

              You can sometimes save money by booking at the last minute. Tour operators eager to sell out their last
              few places may be willing to reduce their usual single supplement. Insight Vacations and Road Scholar are
              two companies that regularly discount or waive single supplements.

              It’s not for everyone, but you may also want to consider staying in a hostel, which charges per bed rather
              than per room. Hostelling International properties tend to be reliably clean and secure, and they’re open
              to travelers of all ages. You can find more hostels and read reviews at HostelWorld.com.

              Tips for Solo Dining
              Eating alone isn’t so bad. Many solo travelers (and frequent business travelers) hate dining by
              themselves, worried that they appear like some worn-out Willy Loman of the road. There’s even a name for
              it: solomangarephobia. (Occasionally the fear is justified—see Terror at the Table for One.) The following
              tips can help you overcome what for many travelers is the most unpleasant aspect of going it alone.

              Chat with the service people. Waiters and waitresses are some of the best local color you’ll find.

              Cafe or outdoor dining is often attractive to single travelers; sitting alone with a book in a cafe isn’t
              as unusual as a table for one at a fancy restaurant.

              Choose a counter seat or a seat at the bar.

              Go to a restaurant that has booths, which offer more privacy.

              Bring reading materials. If you start to feel uneasy sitting alone and staring down at your food, you can
              crack open a book, whip out your phone, or read a magazine.

              If you don’t want to endure yet another public meal alone, use room service or order carry-out from a
              restaurant nearby.

              Eat well. Just because you’re alone and on the run doesn’t mean you shouldn’t take time for sit-down
              meals, a leisurely cup of coffee, or a decadent dessert.

              When You’ve Just About Had It
              The constant sensory input and vigilance of traveling alone can wear you down. If you feel your attention
              or your body flagging, don’t be afraid to back off your ambitious itinerary, slow the pace, and kick back
              for a bit.

              When traveling abroad, seek out an expat bar—locals will often know where these are—where you can hang out
              and speak your native tongue with some fellow expatriates and travelers. When traveling in more familiar
              locales, a hot shower and a night in front of the tube in a nice hotel room can often give you enough of a
              reprieve to send you out eagerly the next morning.
